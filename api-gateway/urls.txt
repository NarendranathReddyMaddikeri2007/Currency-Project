http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-EXCHANGE/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/IND

Above request will provide response as below:
{
    "id": 1001,
    "conversionMultiple": 10,
    "environment": "8001",
    "from": "USD",
    "to": "IND"
}
-----------------------------------------
http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-CONVERSION/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/IND/quantity/250

Above request will give response as below:
{
    "id": 1001,
    "currency_from": "USD",
    "currency_to": "IND",
    "quantity": 10,
    "conversionMultiple": 250,
    "totalCalculatedAmount": 2500,
    "environment": "8001 feign"
}
- So from now we can call any service with eureka with API Gateway.
- If we are implementing authentication, we can use API Gateway here as only authenticated persons are allowed by using API Gateway in microservices.

Initial

- http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-EXCHANGE/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/IND

- http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-CONVERSION/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/IND/quantity/10

- http://localhost:8765/CURRENCY-CONVERSION/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/IND/quantity/250


In the above urls, CURRENCY-EXCHANGE or CURRENCY-CONVERSION seems ugly. To fix that, add below line to application.properties
spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.lower-case-service-id=true

Lower Case

- http://localhost:8765/currency-exchange/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/IND

- http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/IND/quantity/10

- http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/IND/quantity/10

Building Custom Routes:
1) Create configuration file.
